# Assignments

## Custom List
You will need to implement either the LinkedList or the ArrayList found in Assignments/Custom List. choose one to complete, and implement each of the methods therein. You will need to copy the code from both the interface and the type of list you choose. You don't need to do both lists, you can pick linkedlist or arraylist.

You will not need to submit this assignment directly to me, this will be part of your project 0. I just wanted to make sure I published the interface and the scaffolding so you have it.
